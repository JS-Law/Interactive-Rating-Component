# Project Notes

- Definitely feeling the the lost time on these projects!
- I forgot what the hell I needed to do to setup a webpack project lol, I even forgot how to use some of the modules I had created for future use!
- No issues, just gotta keep at it!

- Added some CSS variables. Getting the hang of it again.
- Next time I sit down for this I need to:
  - Create event listener for DOMContentLoaded which calls a function that will preload all of the elements I've created with JavaScript.
